## Fun Facts
- CONREPRO 4.0 was my first coding competition. Not even 4 months of experience and got 2nd place with his team. The leader of the 1st place team and I are now really close friends and keep coding and hanging out together. (Our team were purely people that had less than 4 months of coding experience, everyone else had at least a year and a half of experience)
- First zumobot competition was like a month after CONREPRO 4.0. A friend of mine had problems with a zumobot and had to change a lot of the electronic controll parts. After changing it,  he needed to change a lot of the firmware of the bot and got stressed. I offered some help and got it running in <24hrs, just in time for the competition. This time we didn't win anything, a tire fell from it. But we did have a lot of fun.
- Helped develop a CANSAT in 48 hrs. The story is that there was this team at my highschool that signed up for a competition and they started preparing early on and ordered the parts, bad news, the parts got there 3 days before the competition and got stressed out. They knew about me because of their teacher and tutor for the project. In 15 minutes they told me the story and how everything worked (it was my first CANSAT) and they adopted me as their team leader and built it in two days. Can't say that I'm proud on how it looked after we finished but it survived the landing and we could impress the judges with it. For our surprise, we were the only team there that were still in highschool, the rest of them were college students (and a couple of engineers too). We got a 2nd place that day.
